# Mesh Generation
This concept was first implemented in my earlier repository [WebDev-Concepts](https://github.com/mjj0013/WebDev-Concepts). Some of the differences between these two respositories are that, in the earlier version, about 50 nodes would be randomly generated instead of coming from the user's input and the nodes were draggable. This process of mesh generation can be broken into two steps: building the edges and finding cycles in the graph that become shapes(mostly triangles). The second step is more complicated and hasn't been completely implemented to find the shortest cycles and to detect shapes beyond triangles. Sometimes a random node will be left out of the mesh in the first step and I've yet to fit this. 

### Building Edges
I didn't follow a specific methodology in this first step, so it may not be as optimized as it can be. For each generated node, I would find and store the distances between it and every other node. I would then sort these distances from least to greatest to determine the closest nodes to each node.
I would then reiterate through the list of nodes again. For each node, I would take its top 4 closest nodes and then merge their own top 4 closest nodes into one list of common nodes, removing any repeating values. For each permutation of two nodes in this new list, I would first determine if an edge already exists between them. If an edge doesn't exist, I would then evaluate if the edge had a point of intersect with any other existing edges using this equation:
