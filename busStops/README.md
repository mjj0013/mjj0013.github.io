# Bus Stops
This repository demonstrates how open source platforms such as mapbox allows developers to make very useful applications, and how asynchronous programming plays a role in this. _mapbox_ allows you to create and display maps from real world data on a webpage. Asynchronous programming allows lengthy processes like fetching map data to be placed "in the background" of the program's flow of operation. The bus stops between Harvard and MIT are animated by fetching MBTA bus data.
